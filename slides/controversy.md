### And what about Yeoman?

Yeoman is build on top of grunt. At some point they started having [compatibility issues](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/484),
to which Ben Alman replied with ["Voiding the warranty"](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/issues/432).

There's a long discussion thread on a GitHub issue about the nature of Yeoman,
questioning if it would be better to have [Yeoman as a grunt task](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/297).
